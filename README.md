Scripts and notebooks for theorycrafting in online video games

### wowlogs_lib.py
Module with functions to interact with the warcraftlogs.com website. 
The Warcraft Classic API is still under development. Currently only overall info for each raid is available. Functions are in place to retrieve damage done, healing, damage taken, etc stats.

### classic_warcraft_logs.ipynb
Jupyter notebook making used of the wowlogs_lib.py module

### google_sheets.py
Module to connect with google sheets (Read/Write/Create/Clear/Append)

### file_concatenator.py
Module to concatenate all files in a folder

### wow_retail_player_details.ipynb
Scripts to flesh out the profile details of achievement leaderboards and their guildmates. This is a toy project to test out Tableau public dashboards. The original achievement data was taken from the Subscript repo (final_time_stats.csv)

### wow_classic_items.ipynb
Ongoing project waiting for the blizz api to include a "search by item category id" function. I'm too lazy to scrape wowhead for a billion item ids.

### Data folder
Contains the csv files used or generated by the scripts in the repo
